\title{Get Trend column of report}
\usage{
get_trend(col1, col2, threshold = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{col1}{List. Current data.}

\item{col2}{List. Historical comparison data.}

\item{threshold}{Numeric. Percentage threshold (as decimal) for determining
trend significance. Values within this percentage of the historical value
are considered "Expected". Defaults to 0.0 (any difference triggers trend).}
}
\value{
Character vector containing the trend labels.
}
\description{
'get_trend' compares values of two columns and produces a new column
containing the trend result. The trend is represented by the strings:
"Elevated" (increase), "Less Than Expected" (decrease), and
"Expected" (no change).
}
\examples{
# Without threshold - any difference triggers trend
get_trend(c(5, 10, 10), c(3, 10, 11))

# With 15\% threshold - small changes are "Expected"
get_trend(c(5, 10, 10), c(3, 10, 11), threshold = 0.15)
}
